## Debugging & Analysis

- [Cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) is a static analysis tool for C/C++ code.
  Check with `cppcheck --enable=all source/`
- [Clang Analyser](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/clang#Using_the_Static_Analyzer) - Use like `scan-build make debug`
- [clang-tidy](http://www.labri.fr/perso/fleury/posts/programming/using-clang-tidy-and-clang-format.html)
  Use like `clang-tidy source/*.cpp -checks=*,-clang-analyzer-alpha.*,-llvm-include-order -- -std=c++14 -Iinclude > out.txt`
- Valgrind to check memory leaks.
  Note: Valgrind doesn't work with sanitizers. Info [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42079091/valgrind-gcc-6-2-0-and-fsanitize-address).

### Code coverage

```sh
# Run tests first

gcov source/main.cpp --object-directory build/

lcov --base-directory . --directory build/ --capture --output-file coverage.info

lcov --list coverage.info

genhtml coverage.info -o coverage
```

```
I'm using coveralls + travis CI and am liking it. It gives you nice coverage report for each build and pull request and coverage history for the whole project and each source file. To use it:

Project is built in travis as usual then tests are run, just --coverage is added to compiler and linker flags. For CMake, I setup a special build type:

  SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_COVERAGE "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG} --coverage")
  SET(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_COVERAGE "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_DEBUG} --coverage")
  SET(CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_COVERAGE "${CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_DEBUG} --coverage")
and build with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage

A couple of lines are added to .travis.yml to upload coverage info to coveralls:

Before build: pip install --user pyyaml cpp-coveralls

After successful build: coveralls or coveralls -i <dir> if you need to limit coverage with specific directory

Sign in to coveralls and add your repo. With next build you'll get coverage info.

<a name="code_style"></a>

## Coding Style

Use tabs instead of spaces (unless for precision). Terminate lines with newline character.

Namespace names should be `snake_case`.
Class names should be upper `CamelCase`.
Function, method and variable names should be lower `camelCase`.

## Translating

Create a PO file for your language if it does not exist already.

```sh
cd resources/languages
# Check possible locale codes here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29198907/how-to-get-the-locale-for-a-specified-currency
mkdir zh
# Add `zh` to `DIRS` variable in Makefile.
make LANG="zh" init
```

Open the PO file with [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) and add the translated strings. If you open the PO file with a text editor, don't change the `msgid`s, change only the `msgstr`s! Make sure that the file is saved with UTF-8 encoding. Open it with notepad++ and convert the encoding to UTF-8 w/o BOM.

Compile the PO file into an MO file:

```sh
cd resources/languages
make
```

For updating a PO file in case of source code updates, do:

```sh
cd resources/languages
make update
```
